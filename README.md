# 30-20-10

This application simply helps you follow the "30-20-10" pattern on working out.


## What is this 30-20-10 "pattern"?

 * 30 seconds of low intensity workout
 * 20 seconds of medium intensity workout
 * 10 seconds of maximum intensity workout
 * Rinse and repeat

This pattern (or 10-20-30, same but in slightly different order) has been claimed to produce the most effective results in cardio exercising.


## What does the application actually do?

 * At start, it waits you to press Select (the middle button)
 * When you press the button, it deoes a short vibrate to signify the start for low intensity workout
 * 30 seconds later, it does a long vibrate to signify the start for medium intensity workout
 * 20 seconds later, it does two short vibrates to signify the start for maximum intensity workout
 * 10 seconds later, it does a short vibrate again to signify another low intensity workout mode
 * Press down to stop timers and go back to starting screen
